These may contain default-value mappings for all tags in the\r\n * oneof but the type tag specifies which one was actually set.\r\n *\r\n * 2) Messages that don't contain a type tag: these are the format required by\r\n * GRPC as inputs. If we emitted objects with type tags, ProtoBuf.js would\r\n * choke claiming that the tags aren't fields in the Message.\r\n *\r\n * Allowing both formats here makes the serializer able to consume the outputs\r\n * it produces: for all messages it supports, fromX(toX(value)) == value.\r\n *\r\n * Note that case 2 suffers from ambiguity: if multiple tags are present\r\n * without a type tag then the callers are structured in such a way that the\r\n * first invocation will win. Since we only parse in this mode when parsing\r\n * the output of a serialize method this works, but it's not a general\r\n * solution.\r\n *\r\n * Unfortunately there is no general solution here because proto3 makes it\r\n * impossible to distinguish unset from explicitly set fields: both have the\r\n * default value for the type. Without the type tag but multiple value tags\r\n * it's possible to have default values for each tag in the oneof and not be\r\n * able to know which was actually in effect.\r\n */\r\nfunction hasTag(obj, type, tag) {\r\n    return type === tag || (!type && tag in obj);\r\n}\n\n/**\r\n * Detect React Native.\r\n *\r\n * @return {boolean} True if ReactNative environment is detected.\r\n */\r\nvar isReactNative = function () {\r\n    return (typeof navigator === 'object' && navigator['product'] === 'ReactNative');\r\n};\r\n\nvar ERROR_NAME = 'FirebaseError';\r\nvar captureStackTrace = Error\r\n    .captureStackTrace;\r\nvar FirebaseError = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n    function FirebaseError(code, message) {\r\n        this.code = code;\r\n        this.message = message;\r\n        // We want the stack value, if implemented by Error\r\n        if (captureStackTrace) {\r\n            // Patches this.stack, omitted calls above ErrorFactory#create\r\n            captureStackTrace(this, ErrorFactory.prototype.create);\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            try {\r\n                // In case of IE11, stack will be set only after error is raised.\r\n                // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/stack-property-error-javascript\r\n                throw Error.apply(this, arguments);\r\n            }\r\n            catch (err) {\r\n                this.name = ERROR_NAME;\r\n                // Make non-enumerable getter for the property.\r\n                Object.defineProperty(this, 'stack', {\r\n                    get: function () {\r\n                        return err.stack;\r\n                    }\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return FirebaseError;\r\n}());\r\n// Back-door inheritance\r\nFirebaseError.prototype = Object.create(Error.prototype);\r\nFirebaseError.prototype.constructor = FirebaseError;\r\nFirebaseError.prototype.name = ERROR_NAME;\r\nvar ErrorFactory = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n    function ErrorFactory(service, serviceName, errors) {\r\n        this.service = service;\r\n        this.serviceName = serviceName;\r\n        this.errors = errors;\r\n        // Matches {$name}, by default.\r\n        this.pattern = /\\{\\$([^}]+)}/g;\r\n        // empty\r\n    }\r\n    ErrorFactory.prototype.create = function (code, data) {\r\n        if (data === undefined) {\r\n            data = {};\r\n        }\r\n        var template = this.errors[code];\r\n        var fullCode = this.service + '/' + code;\r\n        var message;\r\n        if (template === undefined) {\r\n            message = 'Error';\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            message = template.replace(this.pattern, function (match, key) {\r\n                var value = data[key];\r\n                return value !== undefined ? value.toString() : '<' + key + '?>';\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n        // Service: Error message (service/code).\r\n        message = this.serviceName + ': ' + message + ' (' + fullCode + ').';\r\n        var err = new FirebaseError(fullCode, message);\r\n        // Populate the Error object with message parts for programmatic\r\n        // accesses (e.g., e.file).\r\n        for (var prop in data) {\r\n            if (!data.hasOwnProperty(prop) || prop.slice(-1) === '_') {\r\n                continue;\r\n            }\r\n            err[prop] = data[prop];\r\n        }\r\n        return err;\r\n    };\r\n    return ErrorFactory;\r\n}());\n\n/**\r\n * Copyright 2017 Google Inc.\r\n *\r\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n *\r\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n *\r\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n * limitations under the License.\r\n */\r\n// Copyright 2011 The Closure Library Authors.
